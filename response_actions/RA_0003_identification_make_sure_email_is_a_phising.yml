  Make sure this email is a phising attack
workflow: |
  Check email and its metadata for evidences of phishing attack:

  - **Impersonalisation attempts**: sender is trying to identify himself as somebody he is not
  - **Suspicious askings or offers**: download "invoice", click on link with something important etc
  - **Psychological manipulations**: invoking a sense of urgency or fear is a common phishing tactic
  - **Spelling mistakes**: legitimate messages usually don't have spelling mistakes or poor grammar
