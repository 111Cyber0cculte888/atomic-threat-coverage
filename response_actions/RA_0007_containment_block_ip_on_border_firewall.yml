  Block ip address on border firewall using native filtering functionality.
  Warning: 
  - If not all corporate hosts access internet through the border firewall, this Response Action cannot guarantee containment of threat.
  - Be careful blocking IP address. Make sure it's not cloud provider or hoster. In this case you have to use blocking by URL something more specific.
