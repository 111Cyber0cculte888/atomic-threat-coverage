  Block domain on NGFW using native filtering functionality.
  Warning: 
  - If not all corporate hosts access internet through the NGFW, this Response Action cannot guarantee containment of threat.
  - Be careful blocking domain names. Make sure it's not cloud provider or hoster. In this case you have to use blocking by URL something more specific.
