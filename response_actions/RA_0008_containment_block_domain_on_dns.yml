  Block domain on DNS Server using native sinkholing functionality. 
  Warning: 
  - If corporate DNS usage is not mandatory and hosts can use public DNS servers (access is not blocked by firewall), this Response Action cannot guarantee containment of threat.
  - Be careful blocking IP address. Make sure it's not cloud provider or hoster. In this case you have to use blocking by URL something more specific.
