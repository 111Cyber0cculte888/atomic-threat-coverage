# T1007 - System Service Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may try to get information about registered services. Commands that may obtain information about services using operating system utilities are "sc," "tasklist /svc" using [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), and "net start" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039), but adversaries may also use other tools as well.</blockquote>
