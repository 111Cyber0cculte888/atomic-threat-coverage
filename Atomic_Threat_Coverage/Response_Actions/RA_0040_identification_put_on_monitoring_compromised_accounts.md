### Workflow

Start monitoring for authentification attempts and all potentially harmful actions from potentially compromised accounts.
Look for anomalies, strange network connections, unusual geolocation/time of work, actions which were never executed before.
Keep in touch with real users and in case of need ask them if they executing these actions by themselves or not.
